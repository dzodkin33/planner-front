# planner-front

This is a frontend component of [ataha332's](https://github.com/ataha322) and mine web-application.

Planner.xyi is a flexible organizer application for students based on a simple checklist. It is designed to enable users to plan and organize their work without any distractions. Planner.xyi focuses on what's really important - deadlines. A straightforward checklist - a foundation of Planner.xyi - allows students to have a clear vision of tasks at hand and their due dates. Customization tools allow for unique design for every possible task description students can encounter. An array of possible displays - from a basic checklist to a calendar - will give students a greater perception of time and workload.
